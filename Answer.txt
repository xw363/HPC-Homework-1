1. On my system, running the array_ring program on 2 processor cores with
an array of 250,000 long integers takes about 69.13 seconds. Each rank runs
125,000 iterations, and each iteration has a send operation and receive
operation (except the first and last ones). Therefore, the bandwidth is
approximately

    2 MB * (2 * 125,000 * 2) / 69.13 sec = 14.47 GB/sec

(Note: The test was done on Ubuntu, which uses base 10 byte units. Hence,
on a x86-64 Ubuntu, 2 MB = 2 * 10^6 Bytes = 250,000 long integers.)

2. If we parallelize the Gauss-Seidel smoother, we need to wait for
u_(i-1)^(k+1) to be updated before updating u_i^(k+1) for i>1. Therefore,
the elements of u^(k+1) cannot be updated in parallel.
