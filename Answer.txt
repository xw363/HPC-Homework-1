1. I ran the array_ring program with an array of 250,000 long integers
on crunchy1 (rank 0) and crunchy5 (rank 1), and it took about 4366.33
second for both servers. Since each rank runs 125,000 iterations, and each
iteration has a send operation and a receive operation, the bandwidth is 

    2 MB * (2 * 125,000 * 2) / 4366.33 sec = 229 MB/sec

2. If we parallelize the Gauss-Seidel smoother, we need to wait for
u_(i-1)^(k+1) to be updated before updating u_i^(k+1) for i>1. Therefore,
the elements of u^(k+1) cannot be updated in parallel.
